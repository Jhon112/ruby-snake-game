# Snake game

## description

This project is a basic recreation of the popular snake game, it has a food object and a snake object.
We use a State class to store the state of our different objects so we can manipulate them and check their attributes, this way we know how to render them, this model is based on Redux.

## usage

To run the application after cloning the project:

```ruby
    bundle
    ruby src/app.rb
```
