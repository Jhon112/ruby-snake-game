# Snake game

## description

This project is a basic recreation of the popular snake game, it has food and snake objects.
A State class is used to store the state of our different objects, that way we can manipulate them and retrieve their attributes so we know how to render them, this model/work-flow is based on Redux.

## usage

To run the application after cloning the project:

```ruby
    bundle
    ruby src/app.rb
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome.
